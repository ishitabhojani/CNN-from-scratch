    2. Basic Fondamentals for understanding Convolutional Nueral Networks
    3. Mathematics for craete the functions of equestions
## Project Description:
Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset. The convolution network should havee a single hidden layer with multiple channels.It should achieve at least 94% accuracy on Test Set.

## Implementation:
In my code, I have import necessary libraries for
